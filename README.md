## Introduction

This project is an example implementation of the [Open Microservice Specification](https://openmicroservices.org), a standard originally created at [Storyscript](https://storyscript.io) for building highly-portable "microservices" that expose the events, actions, and APIs inside containerized software.

## Getting Started

The `oms` command-line interface allows you to interact with Open Microservices. If you're interested in creating an Open Microservice the CLI also helps validate, test, and debug your `oms.yml` implementation!

See the [oms-cli](https://github.com/microservices/oms) project to learn more!

### Installation

```
npm install -g @microservices/oms
```

## Usage

### Open Microservices CLI Usage

Once you have the [oms-cli](https://github.com/microservices/oms) installed, you can run any of the following commands from within this project's root directory:

#### Actions

##### generate

> Generate a UUID v4 like 38788d28-6526-45c5-acf9-bb179160c7d7

```shell
oms run generate
```

## Contributing

All suggestions in how to improve the specification and this guide are very welcome. Feel free share your thoughts in the Issue tracker, or even better, fork the repository to implement your own ideas and submit a pull request.
